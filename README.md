### Predict Google Play Store Applications Ratings

Our goal is to predict whether an app has a good rating or bad rating using features such as the category where the app belongs, the type of the application, whether it's free or paid, number of times the application has been installed from the Play Store, content rating for the app, how recent since the app is updated, number of reviews made for the app on the Play Store, and app's size itself.

A good rating is considered to have a score of 4.2 out of a 5 point mark, otherwise, it is a bad rating. Predicting whether an app has a good or bad rating may help us analyze the efficacy and corret use cases for these applications. With this analysis, it will allow customers and potential users to decide more quickly and decisively in which applications they would want to download. By being able to predict which applications have a quality ranking will allows customers to save time in finding exactly what type of tools they need.
